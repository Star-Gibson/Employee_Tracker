## Project Description: 
The Employee Tracker is a CLI application run using node.JS that allows users to build entire teams using their go-to CLI. Moving forward I will look to add functionality surrounding overview of total company salary, the addition/removal of table items, as well as filtered view options.

When utilizing this application be sure to first run a `npm install` to ensure you have all the necessary dependencies.
